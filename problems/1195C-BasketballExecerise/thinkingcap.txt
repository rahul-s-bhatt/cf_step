2 * n students
2 rows

Rules of choosing:
1) choosen player index > previously choosen player (exc. first one taken)
2) choosen player cannot be same row as previous chosen player
3) A team consists of any no. of students

Answer => To maximize total hts of all chosen students

Now given its arbitary choice system & maximize answer, it requires dynamic programming.

Step 1: Try out the example:
students = 5
row 1 = 9 3 5 7 3
row 2 = 5 8 1 4 5

expected output = 29

iteration 1: we can choose any from 2*n students, choose maximum one?
- 9 ie from Row 1

iteration 2: cannot pick from row 1 and index to choose from must be strictly greater than 0
- 8 ie from Row 2

iteration 3: cannot pick from row 2 and index to choose from must be strictly greater than 1
- 7 ie from Row 1

iteration 4: cannot pick from row 1 and index to choose from must be strictly greater than 3
- 5 ie from Row 2

total = 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 29


okay, so are we able to pattern recognize here to a dp recurrence?
- at each iteration I was trying to find max element and pick that (this will fail and is suboptimal)

- so each step => find max of total ht of choosen student at that index?
